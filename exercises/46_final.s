# ======================================
# Exercise 46: Final Challenge
# ======================================
#
# Write a program that outputs data to stdout.
#
# Behavior:
#   - If an argument is given: open it as a file, output contents
#   - If no argument: read from stdin, output to stdout
#
# This combines everything:
#   - Check argc
#   - Access argv
#   - Conditional logic
#   - File or stdin I/O
#   - Write to stdout
#
# No scaffolding. You know everything you need.
