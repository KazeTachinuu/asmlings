LESSON 04: x86-64 Registers
════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT ARE REGISTERS?

Registers are tiny, ultra-fast storage locations inside the CPU.
Think of them as built-in variables that the CPU can access instantly.

x86-64 has 16 general-purpose 64-bit registers.


THE REGISTERS

  %rax   Accumulator, return values, syscall number
  %rbx   Base register (callee-saved)
  %rcx   Counter, 4th argument
  %rdx   Data, 3rd argument
  %rsi   Source index, 2nd argument
  %rdi   Destination index, 1st argument
  %rbp   Base pointer (callee-saved)
  %rsp   Stack pointer (special!)
  %r8    5th argument
  %r9    6th argument
  %r10   Temporary
  %r11   Temporary
  %r12   Callee-saved
  %r13   Callee-saved
  %r14   Callee-saved
  %r15   Callee-saved


SYSCALL ARGUMENT REGISTERS

For Linux syscalls:
  %rax = syscall number
  %rdi = 1st argument
  %rsi = 2nd argument
  %rdx = 3rd argument
  %r10 = 4th argument  (NOTE: r10, not rcx for syscalls!)
  %r8  = 5th argument
  %r9  = 6th argument


THE BUG

The code puts the exit code (99) into %rsi:

  movq $99, %rsi

But the exit syscall expects the exit code in %rdi (1st argument),
not %rsi (2nd argument)!


YOUR TASK

Fix the register name. The exit code should go in the FIRST argument
register for syscalls.
