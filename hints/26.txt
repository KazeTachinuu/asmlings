Exercise 26: sys_write

The write syscall (number 1) outputs data:
  %rax = 1 (syscall number)
  %rdi = file descriptor (0=stdin, 1=stdout, 2=stderr)
  %rsi = pointer to buffer
  %rdx = number of bytes to write

Returns: number of bytes written (in %rax)

THE PROBLEM:
Two values are wrong:
1. %rdi is 0 (stdin) - should be 1 (stdout)
2. %rdx is 0 (length) - should be 2 (length of "Hi")

TO COMPLETE:
Change these lines:
  movq $1, %rdi     # stdout
  movq $2, %rdx     # 2 bytes
