Exercise 13: Loading from Memory

Data can be stored in the .data section and loaded at runtime.

LOADING SYNTAX:
  movq label(%rip), %rax

The (%rip) makes it "position-independent" - the address is
calculated relative to the current instruction pointer.
This is important for modern executable security features.

THE PROBLEM:
Load the value at 'secret' into %rdi.

TO COMPLETE:
Add this instruction:
  movq secret(%rip), %rdi

This loads the 64-bit value at address 'secret' into %rdi.
