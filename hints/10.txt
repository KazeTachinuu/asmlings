LESSON 10: Bitwise AND - Masking
════════════════════════════════════════

BITWISE OPERATIONS

Bitwise operations work on individual bits, comparing them pair by pair.


AND OPERATION

  andq SOURCE, DEST   →   DEST = DEST & SOURCE

AND produces 1 only if BOTH bits are 1:

  1 AND 1 = 1
  1 AND 0 = 0
  0 AND 1 = 0
  0 AND 0 = 0


MASKING

AND is used to "mask" bits - keeping only certain bits while zeroing others.

A mask of 0x0F (binary: 00001111) keeps the lowest 4 bits (one nibble):

  Value:  0xAB   = 1010 1011
  Mask:   0x0F   = 0000 1111
  Result: 0x0B   = 0000 1011

The high bits become 0, the low 4 bits are preserved.


COMMON MASKS

  0x0F      Keep lowest 4 bits (one nibble/hex digit)
  0xFF      Keep lowest 8 bits (one byte)
  0xFFFF    Keep lowest 16 bits (two bytes)
  0xFFFFFF  Keep lowest 24 bits (three bytes)


THE PROBLEM

You have 0xAB (171 decimal) in %rdi.
You need to extract just the low nibble: 0x0B = 11 decimal.


YOUR TASK

Apply an AND mask to keep only the lowest 4 bits.

  andq $MASK, %rdi

What should MASK be?
