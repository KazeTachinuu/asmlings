Exercise 25: Callee-Save Registers

Some registers MUST be preserved by called functions:

CALLEE-SAVE (you must save/restore if you use them):
  %rbx, %rbp, %r12, %r13, %r14, %r15

CALLER-SAVE (caller must save if it needs them after call):
  %rax, %rcx, %rdx, %rsi, %rdi, %r8, %r9, %r10, %r11

THE PROBLEM:
The caller has 73 in %rbx. Our function clobbers %rbx.
We must save it before clobbering and restore it after.

TO COMPLETE:
Save %rbx at the start:
  pushq %rbx

Restore it before ret:
  popq %rbx

This preserves the caller's value as required.
