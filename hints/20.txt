Exercise 20: Call and Return

call and ret implement function calls:

  call label    # push return address, jump to label
  ret           # pop return address, jump to it

When you 'call', the address of the NEXT instruction is pushed.
When the function does 'ret', it pops that address and jumps back.

THE PROBLEM:
We need to write a function called set_value that:
1. Puts 66 into %rdi
2. Returns

TO COMPLETE:
Add the function at the end of the file:

set_value:
    movq $66, %rdi
    ret

That's it! The function sets %rdi to 66 and returns.
