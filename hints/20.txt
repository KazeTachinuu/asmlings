LESSON 20: Comparison and CPU Flags
════════════════════════════════════════

THE CMP INSTRUCTION

  cmpq B, A

Computes A - B and sets CPU flags. The result is DISCARDED.

Think of it as: "compare A with B" or "how does A relate to B?"


CPU FLAGS

Flags are single-bit values that record information about the last operation.

  ZF (Zero Flag)     Set if result = 0 (A == B)
  SF (Sign Flag)     Set if result < 0 (A < B for signed)
  CF (Carry Flag)    Set if unsigned borrow (A < B for unsigned)
  OF (Overflow Flag) Set if signed overflow


AFTER CMP

  cmpq $50, %rdi     # Computes rdi - 50

  If rdi = 50:  50 - 50 = 0   → ZF = 1
  If rdi = 25:  25 - 50 = -25 → ZF = 0, SF = 1
  If rdi = 75:  75 - 50 = 25  → ZF = 0, SF = 0


CONDITIONAL JUMPS

After cmp, use conditional jumps to branch:

  je   label    # Jump if Equal (ZF = 1)
  jne  label    # Jump if Not Equal (ZF = 0)
  jl   label    # Jump if Less (signed)
  jg   label    # Jump if Greater (signed)


YOUR TASK

The comparison checks if %rdi equals 50.
Currently %rdi is 25, so the jump doesn't happen.

Fix %rdi so the comparison succeeds (makes ZF = 1).
