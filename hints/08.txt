LESSON 08: Multiplication with IMUL
════════════════════════════════════════

THE IMUL INSTRUCTION

imul (Integer MULtiply) has several forms. The most useful:

Two-operand form:
  imulq SOURCE, DEST   →   DEST = DEST * SOURCE

Examples:
  imulq $5, %rax       # rax = rax * 5
  imulq %rbx, %rax     # rax = rax * rbx


THREE-OPERAND FORM

  imulq $5, %rbx, %rax   →   rax = rbx * 5

This multiplies %rbx by 5 and stores the result in %rax.
Useful when you don't want to modify the source.


SIGNED VS UNSIGNED

imul does SIGNED multiplication. For unsigned, there's 'mul' but it's
more complex (uses rdx:rax pair). For most purposes, imul is fine.


THE PROBLEM

You have:
  %rdi = 7
  %rax = 8

You need to multiply them and get 56 in %rdi.


YOUR TASK

Use imulq to multiply the values.

Think about:
- Which register should be the destination?
- The exit syscall reads from %rdi
- After multiplication, the result needs to be in %rdi
