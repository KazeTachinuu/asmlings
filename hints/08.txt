Exercise 08: Division

Division is the most complex arithmetic operation in x86.
idiv divides a 128-bit number (in rdx:rax) by the operand.

SETUP:
  - %rdx = high 64 bits of dividend (clear this for simple division)
  - %rax = low 64 bits of dividend
  - Divisor in any register

AFTER idivq %rcx:
  - %rax = quotient
  - %rdx = remainder

IMPORTANT: Clear %rdx first for simple positive division!

THE PROBLEM:
Calculate 99 / 3 = 33

TO COMPLETE:
Add these instructions:
  xorq %rdx, %rdx   # clear rdx (or: movq $0, %rdx)
  movq $99, %rax    # dividend
  movq $3, %rcx     # divisor
  idivq %rcx        # divide

The quotient (33) ends up in %rax, which gets moved to %rdi.
