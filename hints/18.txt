Exercise 18: Push and Pop

The stack is a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure.
It grows DOWNWARD in memory.

  pushq %rax    # push rax onto stack (rsp -= 8)
  popq %rax     # pop top into rax (rsp += 8)

%rsp (stack pointer) always points to the top of the stack.

THE PROBLEM:
We push 42, then push 99.
Stack: [42, 99] <- 99 is on top
First pop gets 99, second pop gets 42.

TO COMPLETE:
Add these instructions:
  popq %rax     # get 99 (we don't need it)
  popq %rdi     # get 42 (this is what we want)

Or you could pop into any register for the first one.
