Exercise 27: sys_read

The read syscall (number 0) reads input:
  %rax = 0 (syscall number)
  %rdi = file descriptor (0 = stdin)
  %rsi = pointer to buffer
  %rdx = maximum bytes to read

Returns: number of bytes actually read (in %rax)

This exercise is already complete!
The code correctly sets up sys_read and uses the return value
(bytes read) as the exit code.

TO COMPLETE:
Just delete the "# I AM NOT DONE" line.

The test will send "hello" (5 bytes), so exit code will be 5.
