THE WRITE SYSCALL

To write to the screen:

  movq $1, %rax         # syscall number (write = 1)
  movq $1, %rdi         # file descriptor (stdout = 1)
  movq $???, %rsi       # pointer to data
  movq $???, %rdx       # number of bytes
  syscall


FILE DESCRIPTORS

Every program starts with three open file descriptors:
  0 = stdin  (keyboard input)
  1 = stdout (screen output)
  2 = stderr (error output)


GETTING THE ADDRESS

The message is defined in .rodata. To get its address:

  leaq message(%rip), %rsi

This loads the EFFECTIVE ADDRESS of 'message' into %rsi.


THE LENGTH

"Hello" is 5 characters. Put 5 in %rdx.


PUT IT TOGETHER

Four instructions before syscall:
  1. Set %rax to 1 (write syscall)
  2. Set %rdi to 1 (stdout)
  3. Load address of message into %rsi
  4. Set %rdx to 5 (length)
