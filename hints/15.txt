Exercise 15: Comparison

cmpq compares two values by subtracting them and setting CPU flags.
The result is thrown away - only the flags matter.

  cmpq $50, %rdi    # computes rdi - 50, sets flags

FLAGS:
  ZF (Zero Flag): set if result = 0 (values are equal)
  SF (Sign Flag): set if result < 0 (first < second)

After cmp, use conditional jumps:
  je  label   # jump if equal (ZF=1)
  jne label   # jump if not equal (ZF=0)

THE PROBLEM:
The comparison checks if %rdi equals 50.
Currently %rdi is 25, so je doesn't jump.

TO COMPLETE:
Change $25 to $50:
  movq $50, %rdi

Now cmpq $50, %rdi computes 50 - 50 = 0, setting ZF, and je jumps.
