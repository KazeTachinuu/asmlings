Exercise 28: String Length

C strings are null-terminated - they end with byte 0.
To find the length, count characters until you hit 0.

ALGORITHM:
  length = 0
  while *ptr != 0:
    length++
    ptr++

INSTRUCTIONS NEEDED:
  cmpb $0, (%rdi)    # compare byte at address rdi with 0
  je strlen_done     # if zero, we're done
  incq %rax          # length++
  incq %rdi          # ptr++
  jmp strlen_loop    # repeat

Note: cmpb compares BYTES (8-bit), not quads.
(%rdi) means "the value at address rdi" - memory access.

TO COMPLETE:
Add these instructions in strlen_loop:

  cmpb $0, (%rdi)
  je strlen_done
  incq %rax
  incq %rdi
  jmp strlen_loop

"Hello" has 5 characters, so exit code is 5.
