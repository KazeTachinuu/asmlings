Exercise 06: Subtraction

sub performs subtraction: subq SOURCE, DESTINATION
It computes DESTINATION = DESTINATION - SOURCE

CAREFUL WITH THE ORDER:
  subq $10, %rax   means   rax = rax - 10
  NOT                      rax = 10 - rax

The source is what gets SUBTRACTED FROM the destination.

THE PROBLEM:
We have 100 in %rdi and need 77.
100 - 23 = 77, so we need to subtract 23.

TO COMPLETE:
Add this instruction:
  subq $23, %rdi
