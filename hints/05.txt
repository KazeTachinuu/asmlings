Exercise 05: Addition

add performs addition: addq SOURCE, DESTINATION
The result is stored in DESTINATION.

EXAMPLES:
  addq $10, %rax    # rax = rax + 10
  addq %rbx, %rax   # rax = rax + rbx

THE PROBLEM:
We have 10 in %rdi and need 42.
42 - 10 = 32, so we need to add 32.

TO COMPLETE:
Add this instruction:
  addq $32, %rdi

This adds 32 to %rdi, making it 42.
