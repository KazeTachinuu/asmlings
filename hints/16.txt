Exercise 16: Conditional Jumps

After cmpq, you can jump based on the result:
  je   - jump if equal
  jne  - jump if not equal
  jl   - jump if less (signed)
  jg   - jump if greater (signed)
  jle  - jump if less or equal
  jge  - jump if greater or equal

HOW CMP WORKS:
  cmpq $B, %A computes A - B

If A < B, the result is negative -> jl jumps
If A > B, the result is positive -> jg jumps
If A == B, the result is zero -> je jumps

THE PROBLEM:
We're comparing 10 with 20: cmpq $20, %rax
This computes 10 - 20 = -10 (negative).
Is 10 less than 20? Yes! So we want jl.

TO COMPLETE:
Change "jmp less" to "jl less".

jmp always jumps. jl only jumps if less than.
