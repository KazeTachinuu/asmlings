Exercise 12: Bit Shifting

Shifting moves bits left or right.

LEFT SHIFT (shl):
Each position = multiply by 2.
  shlq $1, %rax    # rax * 2
  shlq $3, %rax    # rax * 8 (2^3 = 8)

RIGHT SHIFT (shr):
Each position = divide by 2 (unsigned).
  shrq $1, %rax    # rax / 2
  shrq $3, %rax    # rax / 8

Shifting is MUCH faster than multiplication/division!

THE PROBLEM:
Calculate 5 * 8 using a shift.
8 = 2^3, so we shift left by 3.

TO COMPLETE:
Add this instruction:
  shlq $3, %rdi

This computes rdi = 5 << 3 = 5 * 8 = 40.
