Exercise 03: Moving Data

mov copies data from one place to another.
In AT&T syntax: movq SOURCE, DESTINATION

SIZE SUFFIXES:
  movb - byte (8 bits)
  movw - word (16 bits)
  movl - long (32 bits)
  movq - quad (64 bits)

We use movq because we're working with 64-bit registers.

THE PROBLEM:
We put 25 in %rax, but the exit syscall reads from %rdi.
We need to copy the value from %rax to %rdi.

TO COMPLETE:
Add this instruction between the two existing lines:
  movq %rax, %rdi

This copies the value in %rax into %rdi.
Note: no $ here because we're copying from a register, not an immediate.
