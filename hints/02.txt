Exercise 02: Exit Codes

Exit codes tell the system whether a program succeeded or failed.
By convention: 0 = success, anything else = some kind of error.

THE SYNTAX:
  movq $0, %rdi

  - movq: move quad (64 bits)
  - $0: the literal value 0 ($ = immediate)
  - %rdi: the destination register (% = register)

TO COMPLETE:
Change $0 to $42 in the line:
  movq $0, %rdi

The result should be:
  movq $42, %rdi

WHY IT WORKS:
The exit syscall reads the exit code from %rdi.
Whatever value is in %rdi when you call syscall
becomes the program's exit code.
