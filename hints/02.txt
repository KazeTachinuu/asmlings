LESSON 02: Exit Codes
════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT ARE EXIT CODES?

When a program terminates, it returns a number to the operating system.
This is the "exit code" or "return code."

Convention:
  0       = Success
  1-255   = Various error conditions

In shell scripts, you can check: if command succeeds, do X, else do Y.


CHECKING EXIT CODES

In bash, run your program then check with:

  ./your_program
  echo $?          ← Prints the exit code

Try it! Run any command and check its exit code.


THE INSTRUCTION

  movq $0, %rdi

Breaking this down:
  - mov   = "move" (copy data)
  - q     = "quad" (64-bit operation)
  - $0    = literal value 0
  - %rdi  = destination register

This puts the value 0 into register RDI.


SIZE SUFFIXES

In AT&T syntax, the instruction suffix indicates operand size:
  - movb = byte (8 bits)
  - movw = word (16 bits)
  - movl = long (32 bits)
  - movq = quad (64 bits)

For 64-bit registers (rax, rdi, etc.), use 'q'.


YOUR TASK

Change the exit code from 0 to 42.

Think about:
- Which line controls the exit code?
- What value is currently there?
- What should you change it to?
