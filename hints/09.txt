LESSON 09: Division - The Tricky One
════════════════════════════════════════

WHY IS DIVISION SPECIAL?

Division in x86 is weird because it works with a 128-bit dividend!

The CPU divides the 128-bit number in RDX:RAX (RDX is high 64 bits,
RAX is low 64 bits) by your divisor.


THE DIV INSTRUCTION

  divq DIVISOR

Performs:
  RAX = (RDX:RAX) / DIVISOR   (quotient)
  RDX = (RDX:RAX) % DIVISOR   (remainder)


THE CRITICAL STEP

For simple division where your dividend fits in 64 bits:

  YOU MUST CLEAR RDX TO ZERO FIRST!

If RDX has garbage, you're dividing a huge random number.


THE PATTERN

  xorq %rdx, %rdx     # Step 1: Clear RDX (set to 0)
  movq $100, %rax     # Step 2: Put dividend in RAX
  movq $4, %rcx       # Step 3: Put divisor in any register
  divq %rcx           # Step 4: Divide!
  # Now: RAX = quotient, RDX = remainder


AFTER DIVISION

  RAX = quotient (the answer you usually want)
  RDX = remainder (useful for modulo operations)


YOUR TASK

Calculate 100 / 4 = 25

Follow the four steps. Make sure you clear RDX first!
