Exercise 09: Bitwise AND

AND compares bits pair by pair.
Result is 1 only if BOTH bits are 1.

  1 AND 1 = 1
  1 AND 0 = 0
  0 AND 1 = 0
  0 AND 0 = 0

MASKING:
AND is used to "mask" bits - keeping only certain bits.
0xFF = 11111111 in binary = keeps lowest 8 bits.

EXAMPLE:
  0x1234 = 0001 0010 0011 0100
  0x00FF = 0000 0000 1111 1111
  Result = 0000 0000 0011 0100 = 0x34 = 52

THE PROBLEM:
Extract the low byte from 0x1234 to get 52.

TO COMPLETE:
Add this instruction:
  andq $0xFF, %rdi
