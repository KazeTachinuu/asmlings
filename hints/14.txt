Exercise 14: Storing to Memory

To store a value to memory:
  movq %rax, label(%rip)

THE PROBLEM:
1. Store the value 77 (in %rax) into 'result'
2. Load it back into %rdi

TO COMPLETE:
Add these two instructions:
  movq %rax, result(%rip)    # store rax to result
  movq result(%rip), %rdi    # load result into rdi

First we store, then we load it back. The exit code will be 77.
