Exercise 17: Loops

A loop is just a conditional jump back to an earlier label.

COMMON PATTERN:
  movq $5, %rcx        # counter
loop_start:
  # ... do something ...
  decq %rcx            # counter-- (sets ZF if zero)
  jnz loop_start       # jump if not zero

decq decrements a register and sets the Zero Flag if it becomes 0.
jnz = "jump if not zero" (ZF=0).

THE PROBLEM:
We need to loop 5 times, adding 1 each time.
The loop body already has addq $1, %rdi.
We need to decrement the counter and loop.

TO COMPLETE:
Add these two instructions after addq $1, %rdi:
  decq %rcx
  jnz loop_start

Then the syscall code is reached after the loop ends.
