LESSON 17: Storing Data to Memory
════════════════════════════════════════

STORING TO MEMORY

To store a register value to a memory location:

  movq %rax, label(%rip)

This writes the value in %rax to the memory at 'label'.


LOAD vs STORE

  movq label(%rip), %rax    # LOAD:  memory → register
  movq %rax, label(%rip)    # STORE: register → memory

The direction is determined by which operand is memory.


THE .DATA SECTION

Variables in .data are read-write. You can modify them.

  .section .data
  result: .quad 0           # Starts at 0, can be changed


STORE THEN LOAD

A common pattern is to compute something, store it, then load it back later.
This exercise demonstrates that pattern (even though it's redundant here).


YOUR TASK

1. Store %rax (which contains 77) to 'result'
2. Load 'result' back into %rdi

Two instructions:
  movq %SOURCE, label(%rip)     # Store
  movq label(%rip), %DEST       # Load
