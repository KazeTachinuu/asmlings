Exercise 01: Your First Program

This exercise is already complete! You just need to understand it and
delete the "# I AM NOT DONE" line.

WHAT'S HAPPENING:

1. .global _start
   This tells the linker where the program begins.
   Every program needs an entry point.

2. .text
   This declares the code section. Executable instructions go here.

3. _start:
   This label marks where execution begins.

4. movq $60, %rax
   Put the number 60 into register %rax.
   60 is the "exit" syscall number on Linux.
   The $ means "literal value" (immediate).
   The % means "register name".

5. movq $0, %rdi
   Put 0 into register %rdi.
   This is the exit code (0 = success).
   %rdi holds the first argument for syscalls.

6. syscall
   Ask the kernel to execute syscall #60 (exit).
   The kernel reads %rax for the syscall number
   and %rdi for the first argument.

TO COMPLETE:
Just delete the line "# I AM NOT DONE" and save the file.
