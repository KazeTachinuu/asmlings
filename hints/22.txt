Exercise 22: Stack Alignment

The System V AMD64 ABI requires the stack to be 16-byte aligned
before a 'call' instruction.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- SSE instructions require 16-byte alignment
- C library functions expect it
- Crashes can happen without it

HOW IT WORKS:
At function entry, after 'call' pushed the return address (8 bytes),
%rsp is 8 mod 16. After pushq %rbp (another 8 bytes), it's aligned!

For local variables, always allocate in multiples of 16.

THE PROBLEM:
We need 16 bytes for locals. The function has the prologue but
is missing the stack allocation.

TO COMPLETE:
Add this after movq %rsp, %rbp:
  subq $16, %rsp

This allocates 16 bytes, keeping the stack aligned.
