Exercise 19: Saving Registers

The stack is perfect for temporarily saving registers.

PATTERN:
  pushq %rbx      # save
  # ... use rbx for something ...
  popq %rbx       # restore

THE PROBLEM:
We have 55 in %rdi. We need to save it, let it get clobbered,
then restore it.

TO COMPLETE:
Add pushq before the clobber and popq after:

  pushq %rdi      # save rdi
  movq $999, %rdi # clobber rdi
  popq %rdi       # restore rdi

After popq, %rdi is back to 55.
